      <td>Sigiriya is an old rock castle and palace that stands magnificently 660 feet straight up, erected by King Kashyapa between 473 and 495. It's in Sri Lanka's central province, near the town of Dambulla, in the northern Matale district. There are various platforms that break up the steps and provide a rest stop if needed. Today, the Sigiriya Rock Fortress is a well-known Archeological Treasure, and UNESCO designated it as a World Heritage Site in 1982 under the name "Ancient City of Sigiriya Sri Lanka."</td>

<td>The Galle Fort, also known as the Dutch Fort, is a stronghold on Sri Lanka's southwest coast that was first erected by the Portuguese. The first fortifications, constructed in the late 16th century, were fairly simple. The fort, however, was heavily altered by the Dutch in the 17th century, making it one of the most important archeological, architectural, and historic monuments in Southeast Asia between the 16th and 19th centuries.</td>

<td>Anuradhapura is a city in Sri Lanka's north-central province of Anuradhapura. It's on the banks of the Aruvi Aru River. The best-known of Sri Lanka's ancient ruined towns is Anuradhapura, which is currently protected as an archaeological park and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1982. Huge bell-shaped dagobas (Buddhist memorial shrines, or stupas) constructed of tiny sun-dried bricks, as well as temples, sculptures, palaces, and old drinking-water reservoirs, may all be seen in the immediate neighborhood.</td>
 
 <td>After the collapse of the Anuradhapura Kingdom in 993, Polonnaruwa Kingdom or the Ancient City of Polonnaruwa served as the second capital of Sri Lanka for three centuries, from the 11th to the 13th centuries. It is found in Sri Lanka's north central province. UNESCO designated Polonnaruwa as a World Heritage Site in 1982 under the name Old City of Polonnaruwa due to its archeological importance and ancient technical supremacy.</td>
